This project demonstrates the generation of images from textual descriptions using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). The model is built using the StackGAN algorithm and leverages the CUB-200-2011 dataset, which contains images of birds and their corresponding descriptions. The project also integrates the trained model into a MERN stack application (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) using a Flask API for the backend.
